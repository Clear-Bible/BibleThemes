    "This repository contains digital content from the \"Dictionary of Bible Themes\", edited by Martin H. Manser, Alister E. McGrath, and J. I. Packer (hereafter \"DBT\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "It has been published in various forms by a variety of publishers going back nearly 30 years. The print volume can be cited as:\n",

    "Manser, Martin H. Dictionary of Bible Themes: The Accessible and Comprehensive Tool for Topical Studies. London: Martin Manser, 2009.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is available as long-form digital content from sellers like [Logos Bible Software](https://www.logos.com/product/16107/dictionary-of-bible-themes) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Dictionary-Bible-Themes-Martin-Manser-ebook/dp/B007IA35XE/). \n",

    "This data is a digital decompilation of the sources for the original prose work into a more digital-ready format. While it provides the same content and structure as the original work, it does not attempt to duplicate the original print presentations, but rather endeavors to escape the limitations of print as a format and to support re-use for other applications.\n",

    "## What is the Dictionary of Bible Themes?\n",
    "\n",
    "From the Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Dictionary of Bible Themes was planned to allow its users to identify and explore the leading themes of Scripture – themes such as God, Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, the human race, sin and salvation, the Christian life, the church and the hope of glory.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This Dictionary identifies these, and many other key themes, and traces them throughout the course of Scripture.  The Bible is here allowed to speak for itself, with a minimum of comment and explanation.  The approach adopted in this volume allows its users to come into contact directly with Scripture, rather than having to approach it through the views of commentators.  The main themes of Scripture are identified, key biblical references are provided and the mutual relationship of themes is set out clearly.  Over 2,000 themes detailed in this work cover doctrinal, ethical, historical and cultural subjects.  In addition to dealing with the great themes of the Christian message of salvation, the themes thus also deal with practical issues of Christian living.  This approach allows a unifying of Christian wisdom, both theological and practical, for the edification of God’s people.\n"

    "## What formats are provided?\n",
    "\n",
    "The DBT data is available is several forms in the `data` directory of this repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `markdown`: this consolidates the data for each theme into a readable article. \n",
    "* `json`: this is the most granular representation of the data, and attempts to closely model the original information structure. Consequently, the structure is somewhat complex, as described in DBT Theme Classes below. This form is most suitable for application designers who want to use the data in original ways."
